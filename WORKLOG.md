## 2026-06-27 — Day 0: AI command-center scaffold
**Maps to:** pre–Day 1 setup (AI workflow artifacts + repo skeleton).

**What changed**
- Created the EventHub monorepo skeleton: `services/{core-api,payment-service,notification-service}`, `frontend`,
  `docs/`, `.claude/{skills,commands,agents}`, and root files.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` (system map, comms/auth matrix, response envelope, run instructions, conventions, command index).
- Per-service `CLAUDE.md`: core-api (full Laravel standards + EventHub domain: lifecycle, holds/locking, payout,
  refund policy, cron), payment-service (gateways, idempotency, signed webhooks, inter-service auth),
  notification-service (BullMQ, retry/backoff, DLQ, delivery tracking), frontend (Next.js views, API client).
- Agent skills: `backend-core-api`, `payment-service`, `notification-service`, `frontend`, `laravel-api-endpoint`.
- Slash commands: carried over + annotated `make-endpoint`/`crud`/`add-enum`/`add-resource`/`format-and-test`; added
  `update-worklog`, `day-plan`, `scaffold-service`.
- Subagents: `laravel-code-reviewer`, `laravel-test-writer`, new `financial-logic-reviewer`.
- Planning-doc scaffolds in `docs/`: requirement-analysis, system-architecture (with seeded API contracts),
  erd (seeded Mermaid ERD), technical-decision-log (ADR-01..10 pre-seeded), development-plan (team delegation).
- `PLAN.md` (5-day checklist + priority matrix + rubric coverage) and this `WORKLOG.md`.
- Canonical Laravel convention stubs in `.claude/stubs/laravel/` (copied verbatim by `/scaffold-service`; single
  source of truth, one-time deterministic per-project setup):
  - `LogHelper` — correlation id stored in Laravel `Context` so ONE `trace_id` spans the whole journey (request ->
    queued job -> payment-service -> webhook -> notify job); auto-stamped on every log line, auto-propagated across
    the queue. Recursive redaction of sensitive keys. UUID ids; reuses a valid incoming `Log-Trace-ID` header.
    Deliberately NOT a static property (would leak across jobs in a long-running worker).
  - `AssignLogTraceId` middleware — sets the id once per request from the header or a fresh UUID, echoes it on the
    response. Registered at the front of the `api` group.
  - `ApiResponse` — `{success,data,message,errors}` envelope, metadata-only logging (no token/PII leakage).
  - Propagation wired in docs: outbound calls attach `LogHelper::traceHeaders()`; notification job payloads carry
    `trace_id` so the Node service logs under the same id.

**Decisions (locked in this session → see decision log)**
- Monorepo; payment-service in Laravel; notification-service in Node.js/BullMQ; queue + locks on Redis;
  envelope `{success,message,data,errors}` with real HTTP codes; docker-compose as primary run path.

**Verification**
- Structure + file tree created and listed. No code yet — nothing to test. (Pending: `docker-compose.yml` + root README.)

- Added `docs/ai-workflow.md` — the AI collaboration playbook (judgment-vs-drafting model, review loop, Day 1
  thinking prompts + draft prompts per doc, Days 2–5 execution prompts, the new-dev 30-min path). Linked from root
  CLAUDE.md and README; doubles as the rubric's "reproducible AI workflow / how a new dev uses the skills" artifact.

- Added a **gitmoji commit convention** to root CLAUDE.md §10 (emoji + imperative summary, with a mapping table for
  this repo's change types) and referenced it in `docs/ai-workflow.md` setup + safety habits.

**Next**
- Finish root `README.md` + `docker-compose.yml` (Day 2 prerequisites are mostly scaffolding).
- Begin **Day 1**: fill the planning docs to "Excellent" (edge cases, assumptions, risks, ADR reasoning).
- Then **Day 2**: `/scaffold-service core-api` and `/scaffold-service payment-service`, migrations, auth.
